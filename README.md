Describing some functions or methods or definitions in the code:

processNumbers: This method processes user input to store even and odd numbers in separate arrays. It takes user input for the number of elements, iterates through the input numbers, categorizes them as even or odd, and then prints the even and odd numbers.

findNearestIndex: This method finds the index of the first number among neighboring pairs with the smallest distance between them in an array. It handles edge cases where the array is empty or contains only one element. The absolute difference between neighboring pairs is calculated using the Math.abs method.

convertArrayAndArrayList: This method reads user input to create an array, converts the array to an ArrayList using Arrays.asList(), and prompts the user to input elements for an ArrayList. It then converts the ArrayList back to an array using the toArray() method and displays both the ArrayList and the array to the user.
